# Dev-Ops Life Cycle :

## 1. Waterfall Model 
    
    * Traditional approach of software development
    * Development happens in a step by step manner
    * Requirement Analysis : Programmers accept the client requirements and analyze it
    * Design : Project Plan : Programmers then come up with a project plan and a design architecture
    * Development : Programmers code the application as per the application project plan and design
    * Testing : Testing ensures the application is error-free and meets the requirements
    * Maintenance : After application is delivered, the operations team maintain the application
    
    Disadvantages : 
    * Challenge comes for New Requirements
    
## 2. Agile model

    * Programmers create prototypes to understand client requirements
   
    Advantages :
    * Client requirements are better understood because of the constant feedback
    * Product is delivered much faster as compared to waterfall model
